Ay baby, hey baby
Ay baby, hey baby
You want it all
All alone, walking high on the wire
You want it all
Or you brag that you're lost in the fire
Before you fall
Let me show you me love that you know you've been searching for
You've been searching for
Now you got me saying
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
I see it all
You could run, you could hide if you like
I see it all
See you lost all the light in your eyes
I'm standing tall
Let me show you me love that you know you've been looking for
What you waiting for
Now you got me saying
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
